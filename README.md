# super-awesome-adventure
One of Learn to Code LA's group python projects. We're beginners learning python and building a super awesome adventure game together in 6 weeks!

## Ideas for what to do next:

- Daily standup meetings -- a short check-in on our slack group where we say 1) what we did, 2) what we need help with, 3) what we're going to do next (or something like that? somebody check the Scrum book!)
- Set up a board of sticky notes with To Do, Doing, Done
- Decide on first steps for our project -- what feature do we implement first? what questions do we need to answer before we can get started?
- Fork this repository on GitHub -- see https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/
- Install Python on your computer if you haven't already
- ...what else? (Fork this and add changes to this document!)

## Next in-person meeting

Sunday June 27, probably 5 - 7pm at Mimi's Cafe again
